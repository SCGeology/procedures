# Basemaps

Basemaps are developed for two purposes. First, a topographic map is made for use with field mapping. This basemap takes advantage of base data layers from the National Map Topo template, but substitutes the contours, hillshade, and hydrography with those generated from SCDNR LiDAR data. 
Second, a basemap is developed for the geologic map using much of the same data as the topo map. The data are prepared in ArcGIS, then brought in to Illustrator to be incorporated with geology data into the geologic map layout.
